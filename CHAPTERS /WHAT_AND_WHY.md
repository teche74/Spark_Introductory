# WHY SPARK COMES ? 

- Spark comes as a extended version of hadoop to provied a unified engine which provides distributed functionalities in a single point to reduce complexity and managiblity overhead.


# Spark Architecture ? 

- Spark Architecture contains several components : 
  - Spark SQL : To provide performing SQL queries on data. ALthough it not requires hadoop, it supports Hadoop Storage format like Parquet, Avro, Hive Table etc
  - Spark Real Time Streaming : It allows to perform operation on real time data without storing it on disk for adhoc anlaysis.
  - Standalone User : It provides single node system or local configuration for learning purpose.
  - Spark MLlib : It provides general Model creation, evaluation and other various techniques.
  - Spark GraphX : It provides algorithms and tuned customized Spark core api for creating vertex and edges , directed graphs etc.
  - YARN : Resource Manager for Spark.
  - Mesos : Cluster manager which operates on dynamic envoirnment and condition.
